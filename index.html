        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
        <p> The smart sleep mask utilizes brainwave sensors to monitor sleep patterns and stages in real-time. It aims to improve sleep quality by analyzing brainwave data, offering personalized suggestions, and using features like sound therapy or gradual
            wake-up lights. Target Customer: This product targets individuals with sleep disorders, those seeking to improve sleep quality, and people interested in health-tech solutions. It is especially useful for frequent travelers, professionals,
            and athletes looking to optimize rest. Problem Statement: Many people struggle with poor sleep quality, which impacts overall health and productivity. Traditional sleep masks only block out light but do not provide insight into the weare rsleep
            stages or brain activity.Brainwave Monitoring: Electroencephalography (EEG) sensors in the mask detect brainwave patterns. • Data Analysis: The collected data is analyzed to determine sleep stages (light, deep, REM). .Sleep Enhancement: Features
            like white noise, gentle vibrations, or light therapy help improve sleep. • Feedback: The data is synced with an app that provides sleep insights and recommendations. Prototype Model: The prototype includes a comfortable, lightweight sleep
            mask with embedded EEG sensors and Bluetooth connectivity to a smartphone app. The app tracks brainwave patterns and offers real-time data and sleep improvement suggestions.
